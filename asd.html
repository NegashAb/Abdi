            HTML is an acronym for HyperText Markup Language, and it is the
            standard language for creating web-pages. Every web page you surf on
            your browser is built using HTML. The primary use of HTML to provide
            a proper structure to the web-page so all the content or data of the
            page could represent adequately. A stand-alone HTML can create only
            static and skeleton looking black and white pages, but with the help
            of CSS and JavaScript , we can create a more interactive and
            intuitive web-page. When we try to visit a website or click on the
            link, we basically request the server to show us the page, then the
            server acts on our request and sends us an appropriate HTML document
            as a response. Then this HTML document parsed by browse, and we able
            to see the content.

            However, you can use notepad to create and edit HTML documents, but
            we recommend to install an open-source editor. There are many free
            to use text-editor software present on the internet, which provides
            a better interactive User interface and some add-on functionality
            which you miss on a notepad.

            The HTML elements provide the semantic meaning to the web-page
            content. We usually interchangeably use the term HTML elements and
            tags, but technically both are different. An HTML tag is just a
            character inside the angle bracket<>, whereas the HTML element is a
              collection of starting tag, its attribute, content and end tag. For
              example:
          </p>
          <pre>&lt;p class= "para"&gt; Hello World &lt;/p&gt;</pre>

        <h2>HTML Attributes</h2>
        <article><!--this is artiiclefor html code-->
          <p><!--this is another paragraph for html code-->
            In HTML, the attributes are used to provide additional information
            about the elements. For most of the HTML elements, attributes are
            optional, but there are some elements where we have to deliver the
            attributes. Attributes always specified within the opening tag of
            the HTML element and they specified in a name and value pair.
            <strong> Example </strong><!--this is bold the text for html code-->
          </p>
          <pre>&lt;image src= "cat.jpg" alt ="cat image"&gt;</pre>
          <p><!--this is another paragraph for html code-->
            In this example src ="cat.jpg" and alt="cat image" are two
            attributes where src and alt are attributes name and "cat.jpg" and
            "cat image" are attributes values. Here alt attribute is optional,
            but src is mandatory because src specify which image to show. There
            should be at least one space gap between two attributes, and the
            value of the attributes must have resided in the double inverted
            comma. Some most important HTML

        <h2>HTML Heading</h2><!--this is headig 2 for html code-->
        <p><!--this is paragraph  for html code-->
          To display the section heading, title or subtitle we can use the HTML
          heading tags. In HTML 5 we have 6 heading tags start from &lt;h1&gt;
          up to &lt;h6&gt;, where &lt;h1&gt; specify the largest heading and
          &lt;h6&gt; represent the smallest or sub heading. If the content is
          specified by heading tags, then it would be displayed large and bold
          as compared to other text content present on the web-page.

    What is the difference between HTML and XHTML?
     HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages, 
     while XHTML is a stricter and more standardized version of 
     HTML. Both HTML and XHTML include a wide range of 
     features, such as support for multimedia, styling, and scripting.
     The key difference between HTML and XML is that HTML displays data and describes the 
     structure of a webpage, whereas XML stores and transfers data. 
     •	XHTML stands for EXtensible HyperText Markup Language
     •	XHTML is a stricter, more XML-based version of HTML
     •	XHTML is HTML defined as an XML application
     •	XHTML is supported by all major browsers
     HTTP Version 1.0
      the first version of HTTP only allowed getting 
      information from a server. However, it became insufficient as the Internet 
      evolved and new functionalities arose.
      In this context, version 1.0 of HTTP was released in 1996, about five 
      years after version 0.9.
      Version 1.0 of HTTP brings several new utilities. Let’s see some of them:
        •	Header: only the method and the resource name composed an HTTP 
          0.9 request. HTTP 1.0, in turn, introduced the HTTP header, thus 
          allowing the transmission of metadata that made the protocol flexible 
          and extensible
        •	Versioning: the HTTP requests explicitly informs the employed version, 
          appending it in the request line
        •	Status code: HTTP responses now contain a status code, thus 
          enabling the receiver to check the request processing status (successful 
          or failed)
        In summary, HTTP 1.0 got much more robust than the 0.9 version. The 
        most responsible for the protocol improvements are the HTTP header and the 
        new HTTP methods
      HTTP Version 1.1
       Version 1.1 of HTTP was released in 1997, only one year after the 
       previous version 1.0. HTTP 1.1 is an enhancement of HTTP 1.0, providing 
       several extensions
    Among the most relevant enhancements, we can cite the following:
     •	Host header: HTTP 1.0 does not officially require the host header. 
      HTTP 1.1 requires it by the specification. The host header is specially 
      important to route messages through proxy servers, allowing to 
      distinguish domains that point to the same IP
    •	Persistent connections: in HTTP 1.0, each request/response pair 
      requires opening a new connection. In HTTP 1.1, it is possible to 
      execute several requests using a single connection
    •	Continue status: to avoid servers refusing unprocessable 
     requests,  now clients can first send only the request headers and check 
     if they receive a continue status code (100) 
    HTTP Version 2.0
    HTTP version 2.0 was officially released in 2015, about eighteen years 
    after the HTTP 1.1. Particularly, HTTP 2.0 focused on improving the protocol 
    performance.
    To do that, HTTP 2.0 implemented several features to improve connections 
    and data exchange. Let’s see some of them:
    •	Request multiplexing: HTTP 1.1 is a sequential protocol. So, we can 
     turn, allows to send requests and receive responses asynchronously. In 
     this way, we can do multiple send a single request at a time. HTTP 2.0, 
     in requests at the same time using a single connection
    •	Request prioritization: with HTTP 2.0, we can set a numeric 
     prioritization in a batch of requests. Thus, we can be explicit in which 
     order we expect the responses, such as getting a webpage CSS before 
     its JS files
    •	Automatic compressing: in the previous version of HTTP (1.1), we 
     must explicitly require the compression of requests and responses. 
     HTTP 2.0, however, executes a GZip compression automatically
  HTTP Version 3.0
   HTTP 3.0 is an Internet-Draft, different from the previous HTTP versions,
   which were/are Request For Comments (RFC) documents of the Internet 
   Engineering Task Force (IETF). Its first draft was published in 2020.
   The main difference between HTTP 2.0 and HTTP 3.0 is the employed 
   transport layer protocol. In HTTP 2.0, we have TCP connections with or 
   not TLS (HTTPS and HTTP). HTTP 3.0, in turn, is designed over QUIC 
   (Quick UDP Internet Connections)-->
